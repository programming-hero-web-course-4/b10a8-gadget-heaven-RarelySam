# Fundamental concepts of react used in the project
Not many have been used because useContext() was way too confusing.

However, I used concepts like:
1. Components
2. Hooks
3. Router

I used local storage for data management.

1. Interactive buttons
2. Gorgeous UI
3. Ability to add products to wishlist/cart
4. Ability to buy products
